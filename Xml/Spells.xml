    <Description>
      You assume a different form. When you cast the spell,

      last for the duration o f the spell. While the spell lasts,
      you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits
      o f a different one.
      Aquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an
      aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing
      webbing between your fingers. You can breathe
      underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your
      walking speed.
      Change Appearance. You transform your appearance.
      You decide what you look like, including your height,
      weight, facial features, sound o f your voice, hair length,
      coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.
      You can make yourself appear as a member o f another
      race, though none o f your statistics change. You also
      can’t appear as a creature o f a different size than you,
      and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal,

    <ShortDescription>Animal travels to a location and a recipient and delivers a message.</ShortDescription>
    <Description>
      By means o f this spell, you use an animal to deliver a
      message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range,
      such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a
      location, which you must have visited, and a recipient
      who matches a general description, such as “a man or
      woman dressed in the uniform o f the town guard” or “a
      red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak
      a message o f up to twenty-five words. The target beast
      travels for the duration o f the spell toward the specified
      location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a
      flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.
      When the messenger arrives, it delivers your m essage
      to the creature that you described, replicating the sound
      o f your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature
      matching the description you gave. If the messenger
      doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the
      message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to
      where you cast this spell.
      At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell
      slot o f 3nd level or higher, the duration o f the spell
      increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

    <ShortDescription>Transform each target into a CR 4 or lower beast.</ShortDescription>
    <Description>
      Your m agic turns others into beasts. Choose any
      number o f willing creatures that you can see within
      range. You transform each target into the form o f a
      Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating o f 4 or
      lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to
      transform affected creatures into new forms.
      The transformation lasts for the duration for each
      target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
      You can choose a different form for each target. A
      target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics o f
      the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment
      and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The
      target assumes the hit points o f its new form, and when
      it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number
      o f hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as
      a result o f dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
      carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
      damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0
      hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is
      limited in the actions it can perform by the nature o f its
      new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.
      The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target
      can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any o f
      its equipment.

    <Description>
      This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile
      o f bones or a corpse o f a Medium or Small humanoid
      within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul
      mimicry o f life, raising it as an undead creature. The
      target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a
      zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature’s
      game statistics).
      On each o f your turns, you can use a bonus action
      to mentally command any creature you made with
      this spell if the creature is within 60 feet o f you (if you
      control multiple creatures, you can command any or all
      o f them at the same time, issuing the same command to
      each one). You decide what action the creature will take
      and where it w ill move during its next turn, or you can
      issue a general command, such as to guard a particular
      chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the
      creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
      Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it
      until its task is complete.
      The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
      after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given
      it. To maintain control o f the creature for another
      24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
      again before the current 24-hour period ends. This
      use o f the spell reasserts your control over up to four
      creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
      animating a new one.
      At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
      spell slot o f 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert
      control over two additional undead creatures for each
      slot level above 3rd. Each o f the creatures must come
      from a different corpse or pile o f bones.

    <Description>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. 
    You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. 
    Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
    You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. 
    Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.
Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. 
    When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet o f it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. 
    The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. 
    While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target.
    If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.
Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. 
    When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target.
    When the creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the target. 
    If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. 
    On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical.
    In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.
    A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</Description>

    <Description>  You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.
  The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.
  Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.</Description>

    <ShortDescription>Transport to the astral plane </ShortDescription>
    <Description>   You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state o f suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.
    Your astral body resembles your m ortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition o f a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
    Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and  possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
    Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
    The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.
    The spell might also end early for you or one o f your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state o f suspended animation.
    If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</Description>

    • Weal and woe, for both good and bad results

If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</Description>

    <ShortDescription>Create a hand of force that punches, grapples, pushes, or blocks.</ShortDescription>
    <Description>You create a Large hand o f shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.
The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength o f 26 (+8) and a Dexterity o f 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.
When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one o f the following effects with it.
  Clenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet o f it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
  Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check o f the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet o f it.
  Grasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet o f it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
  Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target. 
  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</Description>
