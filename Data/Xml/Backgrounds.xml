              Description = "You have spent your life in the service of a temple
                to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an
                intermediary between the realm of the holy and the
                mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering
                sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the
                presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a
                cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as
                channeling divine power.
                Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other
                quasi-divine being from among those listed in appendix
                B or those specified by your DM, and work with your
                DM to detail the nature of your religious service.
                Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
                childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or
                were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call
                to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were
                the leader of a small cult outside of any established
                temple structure, or even an occult group that served a
                fiendish master that you now deny.">

              Description="As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who
                share your faith, and you can perform the religious
                ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring
                companions can expect to receive free healing and
                care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence
                of your faith, though you must provide any material
                components needed for spells. Those who share
                your religion will support you (but only you) at a
                modest lifestyle.
                You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated
                to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a
                residence there. This could be the temple where you
                used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a
                temple where you have found a new home. While near
                your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance,
                provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and
                you remain in good standing with your temple."
