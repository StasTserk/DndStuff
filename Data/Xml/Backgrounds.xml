                to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an
                intermediary between the realm of the holy and the
                mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering
                sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the
                presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a
                cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as

                DM to detail the nature of your religious service.
                Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
                childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or
                were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call
                to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were
                the leader of a small cult outside of any established
                temple structure, or even an occult group that served a
                fiendish master that you now deny.">
