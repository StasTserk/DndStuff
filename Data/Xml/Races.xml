  <Race Name="High Elf"
        Description="As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of
          at least the basics o f magic. In many of the worlds
          of DnD, there are two kinds of high elves. One type
          (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of
          Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the
          sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and
          reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to
          non-elves and even other elves. The other type
          (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the
          Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves
          of the Forgotten Realms) are more common
          and m ore friendly, and often encountered
          among humans and other races.
          The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold
          elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and
          hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their
          eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also
          called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler,
          with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue.
          They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue,
          but various shades of blond, brown, and red are
          not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and
          flecked with gold."

  <Race Name="Half-Orc"
        Description="Whether united under the leadership of a mighty
        warlock or having fought to a standstill after years
        of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form
        alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror
        of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are
        sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs
        rise to become proud chiefs o f orc tribes, their human
        blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc
        rivals. Some venture into the w orld to prove their worth
        among humans and other more civilized races. Many of
        these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their
        mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs
        and savage fury."
