              While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
              aren’t wearing heavy armor:
              • You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
              saving throws.

              • When you make a melee weapon attack using
              Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
              increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown
              in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.

              • You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
              slashing damage.

              If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
              concentrate on them while raging.

              Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
              knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
              haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
              or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
              on your turn as a bonus action.

              Once you have raged the number of times shown
              for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
              Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
              can rage again."
