              Name="Rage"
              Description="In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
              you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
              While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
              aren’t wearing heavy armor:
              • You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
              saving throws.

              • When you make a melee weapon attack using
              Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
              increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown
              in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.

              • You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
              slashing damage.

              If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
              concentrate on them while raging.

              Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
              knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
              haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
              or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
              on your turn as a bonus action.

              Once you have raged the number of times shown
              for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
              Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
              can rage again."

              Description="While you are not w earing any armor, your Armor Class
              equals 10 + your Dexterity m odifier + your Constitution
              modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit."

              Description="Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern
              for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When
              you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide
              to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on
              melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
              turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until
              your next turn."

              nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge
              when you dodge away from danger.
              You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
              against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.
              To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or
              incapacitated."
